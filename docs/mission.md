# Community and Project

- Strive to be a well managed open source project
    - Decentralized governance in line with what people expect
        - We should be able to pass most open source project health checks a [typical OSPO](https://todogroup.org/guides/#ospo-guides) would use when doing due diligence. We're not there yet but it's an achievable goal
    - Project resources designed to be shared and decentralized, no BDFL-like structures
    - Goal to join a foundation or cooperative that can ensure long-term viability of the project
    - Ensure that we're meeting our transparency goals, long term trust is a goal for us so we have to have processes in place to avoid the bus factor
  - A well structured and diverse Community
    - Explicit [Community Values](https://ublue.it/values/) and Code of Conduct
  - Be unique, we are not a distro
    - Indie distros are fun, but making distros is a soul sucking exercise in frustration and pain. 
    - We want to give people what they want with a focus on sustainability and maintenance, more like "My expert linux friend set up my Fedora for me" than a fork or derivative
    - Members of the team have multiple decades of linux distro experience, distros are hard, so we're not making a "Linux distro"

!!! quote "Mission Statement"

    Our mission is not to get caught up in mission statements. A mission statement locks us into a certain mindset. We need to be nimble, because our audience changes faster than you can write a mission statement. Our mission: Just make Linux fun.

# Relationship with Fedora

- We understand that due to the nature of the software we include that we can never be endorsed by the Fedora project
    - This is fine, we're hot rodders and tinkerers
- Be a good partner for Fedora
    - We are doing things that Fedora cannot do and there will be Fedora maintainers who will disagree with at least some aspects of this project
    - Nevertheless, we exist, so we're going for it
    - We want to leverage as much QA from Fedora as possible, so we shouldn't ship kernel patches or any other thing that adds extra maintenance
        - Instead we encourage people to participate in Fedora, that's what it's there for. 
        - The vibe we're looking for is a speed shop, like [Hoonigan](https://www.hoonigan.com/), but we want to remain sustainable, the fork button is always there in github, so if people want to go harder they have the freedom to do so, hence:
