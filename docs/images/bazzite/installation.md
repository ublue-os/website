# Installing Bazzite and Initial Setup
This guide is a visual guide for those who are unfamiliar with desktop Linux and want to install Bazzite.

# Prerequisites:
* Make sure you meet the [system requirements](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/release-notes/welcome/Hardware_Overview/) for Fedora.
* A graphics card that can utilize Vulkan 1.3 or later, but most modern AMD, Nvidia, and Intel GPUs should be fine.
* A USB flash drive, external drive, or microSD card with at least 3GB of free space on it **(keep in mind this will remove existing data on it)**
* Download an ISO release [here.](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/releases)
* Software to flash the image to your flash drive or external drive.  We recommend using [Fedora Media Writer,](https://www.fedoraproject.org/en/workstation/download/) [Balena Etcher,](https://etcher.balena.io/) or [Rufus.](https://rufus.ie/en/)
* Manual partitioning is unsupported.
* See [Fedora Kinoite documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-kinoite/installation/) and [Fedora Silverblue documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/installation/) for more information.

* **bazzite** is the AMD/Intel GPU general desktop image intended for most personal computers.
* **bazzite-nvidia** is _bazzite_ but for PCs running Nvidia GPUs as they include their proprietary drivers in the image.
* **bazzite-deck** is a special Steam Deck image of Bazzite.  More details on that [here.](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite#steam-deck)
* **bazzite-gnome** is bazzite, but instead of using [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as the desktop environment, it uses [GNOME.](https://www.gnome.org/)
* **bazzite-gnome-nvidia** is _bazzite-gnome_ but for PCs running Nvidia GPUs as they include their proprietary drivers in the image.
* **bazzite-deck-gnome** is _bazzite-deck_ but instead of using [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) as the desktop environment, it uses [GNOME.](https://www.gnome.org/)


## KDE Plasma and GNOME Desktop Environments Differences at a Glance

### KDE Plasma:

# Wayland and X11

In short, Wayland and X11 (also known as Xorg or the X Window System) are windowing systems for desktop Linux.

* Wayland is the default for most of the images and the recommended option for Bazzite.  However, the Nvidia images default to X11
* X11 is a legacy windowing system.  While we recommend to stick with Wayland, there may be scenarios where X11 would have to be used.  Nvidia GPUs may have issues with Wayland.

## Waydroid

If you wish to use Waydroid, a setup guide can be found [here](/images/bazzite/waydroid).
