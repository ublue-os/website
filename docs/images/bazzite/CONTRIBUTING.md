<p style="text-align: center; font-weight: 600; color: red">We want YOU to contribute to Bazzite and Universal Blue. </p>

Bazzite is an image from [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org/) and you should follow Universal Blue's [contribution guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING/) before proceeding.  

Check out the Bazzite's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues) to see what issues users are currently experiencing.  Also check out the current [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/projects/1/views/1) for Universal Blue.

If you feel comfortable with bash scripting, working with containers, or anything upstream (Fedora, Flatpak, etc.) then contributing to Bazzite and the Universal Blue project might be for you!  

### Major Overhauls
- Installation process
    - Skills in [Lorax](https://weldr.io/lorax/f28-branch/lorax.html) and the [Anaconda installer](https://www.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Anaconda).
- [YAFTI (Bazzite Portal)](https://github.com/ublue-os/yafti/)
    - Intended as both a first-time boot application, system configuration utility, and application installer that can be used anytime.
    - You can also PR or suggest any applications that you would like installed with the Bazzite Portal.
    - Prior Python knowledge would be helpful. 
- GUI for switching deployments.
    - Our images are able to produce 90 days of rollbacks from Github.
- GUI for rebasing images without having to enter a terminal command.
- GUI for other `just` commands that don't fit in the first-boot utility (Bazzite Portal).
- Implementing [Glamour](https://github.com/charmbracelet/glamour) and [Gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum) in Bazzite.

### The Little Things Add Up
- Adding features or fixing bugs by submitting a pull request.
- Reporting issues and feature requests to either our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/discussions/categories/bazzite).
- Documentation surrounding Bazzite and Universal Blue.
    - Language translations are also welcomed.
- Testing Bazzite on unique hardware configurations.
    - Troubleshooting other handheld PCs that are NOT the Steam Deck would be appreciated.
- Tutorials and showcases of Bazzite in the media.
