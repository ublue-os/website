# FAQ

## Why is it called Bazzite?

Fedora's image-based variants are usually named after either [minerals](https://fedoraproject.org/kinoite/) or [flowers](https://fedoraproject.org/sericea/).
## How do I install Bazzite onto my device?

Follow this [guide](/images/bazzite/installation/).

## Can I dual/multi-boot?

Windows dual-booting can be made to work, but is **not recommended** since Windows has a habit of destroying your boot loader.  The best method would be running Windows on a different drive than the one containing Bazzite, like an external one.  Other Linux distributions **should not** be dual/multi-booted due to how Bazzite mounts certain things.  However you can probably do it if the other Linux OS is on a separate drive.

## Why is my installer not working (dracut issue / black screen)

This is currently a known [issue](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues/109).  There is a [workaround](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues/109#issuecomment-1691090533) that requires either the stock Fedora Silverblue or Fedora Kinoite ISO and rebasing to Bazzite from there after installation.  
!!! warning

    Keep in mind that the Steam Deck will not scale properly with the installer, and the buttons on the bottom of the screen will be cut off.  This will require use of the `TAB` key on your keyboard to navigate the installer blindly.

## How do I run Windows applications?

* Use Lutris (preinstalled).
* [Bottles](https://flathub.org/apps/com.usebottles.bottles) for general purpose applications or as an alternative to Lutris.
* [Heroic](https://flathub.org/apps/com.heroicgameslauncher.hgl) for Epic, GOG, and Amazon Games Launcher.

## How do I run Android applications?

Follow the [Waydroid guide](/images/bazzite/waydroid/).

## How do updates work?

### **For *bazzite*, *bazzite-nvidia*, *bazzite-gnome*, and *bazzite-gnome-nvidia*:**

System updates happen automatically daily.  They will be downloaded in the background and will apply on shutdown.  No forced reboots or worrying about manually updating your system.

Flatpak applications (installed from *Discover* or *GNOME Software*) update twice a day automatically.

You can however force update to the whole system (base packages, applications, and containers) at any time by opening your host terminal and entering `just update` then reboot your device after it has finished.

### **For *bazzite-deck* and *bazzite-deck-gnome*:**

Similar to SteamOS, updates are handled by Steam.  In Game Mode, go to Settings > System > click "Apply"

Alternatively, you can open a host terminal and enter `just update` then reboot your device after it has finished.

## How do I install additional software?

### Flatpak

Typically it is recommended to use Flatpak for most software.  These can be installed via the software center that is preinstalled like *Discover* or *GNOME Software*.  Take a look at the [selection](https://flathub.org/apps/collection/popular/1).

### AppImage

AppImages can be installed by downloading any file with an `.AppImage` extension.  These are usually found on a project's website, [Appimage Hub](https://www.appimagehub.com/) or if you install [Appimage Pool](https://flathub.org/apps/io.github.prateekmedia.appimagepool). Then giving the AppImage application executable permssions in the file's properties to run.

!!! Note
    AppImages are not supported in other Universal Blue images.

### Distrobox

Distrobox containers can be made with the host terminal following this [documentation](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/usage/distrobox-create.md). Keep in mind that `bazzite-arch` is a `distrobox` container that uses `pacman` as the package manager and can utilize the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/).

You can use [other distributions](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox/blob/main/docs/compatibility.md#containers-distros) inside their own containers.

### Nix

If you opted to use Nix packages at the first boot, then you can use the Nix package manager.  More information on that [here](https://zero-to-nix.com/).

### rpm-ostree

Fedora has [documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/package-management/rpm-ostree/) on rpm-ostree.  The most common command you will use is `rpm-ostree install <package>` to layer Fedora's RPM packages to the image.  After that has finished you will be required to reboot your system to use it.  However, it is highly recommended to only use this command as the last resort especially if the package can be obtained through the above methods.

## Do I have to reboot after every `system` update or layering a package?

No. They just won't apply until shutdown.  You can attempt to layer package(s) without rebooting with `rpm-ostree install --apply-live <package>` but sometimes this still requires a reboot depending on the package(s) you installed.

## How do I rollback a system update?

Read Fedora's official [documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-silverblue/updates-upgrades-rollbacks/#rolling-back) on this.  You can pin your current deployment with `sudo ostree admin pin 0` in a host terminal.  You can also rollback in the GRUB menu.

## Why use Fedora? SteamOS is based on Arch Linux.

SteamOS is based on Arch Linux, but the base packages and drivers get updates at a much slower pace than using vanilla Arch and updating yourself. Bazzite will follow Fedora's updates which means it will always be ahead of SteamOS in terms of newer software and drivers.

## How does Bazzite differ from other Linux distributions?

Like SteamOS, Bazzite makes use of read-only root files for stability purposes.

Bazzite is built off of desktop versions of Fedora built with [libostree](https://ostreedev.github.io/ostree/) which has advantages such as:

* Atomic upgrades.
* Containerized applications. (**No dependency hell!**)
* Overlay system packages to the host.
* Smoother upgrade process from major Fedora point releases.
* Very little risk of a non-booting or broken system.
* Rollback system updates.

Check out the [Universal Blue homepage](https://universal-blue.org) for more information.

## Is this another fringe distro?

No. Bazzite is not a distribution. This is Fedora Kinoite/Silverblue (depending on the desktop environment you choose) with a recipe on top of it.  

Unlike traditional Linux distributions, much of the maintenance and security updates are done upstream by Fedora and Universal Blue while Bazzite only configures a great gaming experience out of the box. Check the [mission statement](/mission) and [documentation](https://universal-blue.org/introduction/) for more information.

## For the desktop edition, why run Steam in an Arch Linux Distrobox container as opposed to Flatpak?

Steam is not built with flatpak in mind. Valve does not contribute to it, and as a result there are many workarounds that the Arch package does not have to worry about it. The Steam Deck uses the Arch package, and to stay consistent with SteamOS so do we.

Running Steam in Distrobox has the advantage of using [LatencyFleX](https://github.com/ishitatsuyuki/LatencyFleX) and other packages added to the container.  It can also utilize the latest Mesa drivers releases without the end user having to worry about ABI considerations.

There is a [minor performance impact](https://github.com/flatpak/flatpak/issues/4187) if you run/attempt to run Flatpak games. However it is only noticeable with certain edge cases.

## How do I switch to a different Bazzite image?

You can rebase to a Bazzite or general Universal Blue image by entering the command in a host terminal found on this [page].  After it is finished, reboot your system.

You can also rebase to a stock Fedora imaged-based desktop image by entering in a host terminal `ostree remote refs fedora` to see a list of available Fedora images that you can rebase to.  Afterwards enter `rpm-ostree rebase <image>` and wait for it to install the image then reboot.

##  I am experiencing a bug or want to request a feature, but I'm not sure where to report it.
Explain your issue or proposal in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/issues) or [Github Discussions Page](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite/discussions).

In order to troubleshoot the issue properly, you should add a log or terminal output of the issue.  

Example 1: For a game running on Steam through Proton, go to the game's properties and type `PROTON_LOG=1 %command%` in the launch options section.  Play the game and the log should appear by the appid in Home.  Make sure to attach that to the issue you have.

Example 2: For a Flatpak application that has issues, get the Flatpak package name of all installed applications by entering `flatpak list` (you may need to readjust the terminal window to get the package name to fit beforehand.)  After you got the name, enter `flatpak run <flatpak.package.name>` and a console output will appear.  Copy and paste into a text file, save it, and attach it.
