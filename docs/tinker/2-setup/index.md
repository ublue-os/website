# Setting up the repository

This section helps you set up a GitHub repository for building your custom image and signing it.

There are two ways to do this step automatically, [with a command line program](https://universal-blue.org/tinker/2-setup/auto-cli/) and [with a web interface](https://universal-blue.org/tinker/2-setup/auto-web/).

We also supply [manual instructions](https://universal-blue.org/tinker/2-setup/manual/) for setting up the repository. They require a bit more familiarity with the command line and reading comprehension, but it's not too hard to do.
