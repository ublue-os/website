# Setting up the repository

This section helps you set up a GitHub repository for building your custom image and signing it.

There are two ways to do this step automatically, with a command line program and with a web interface.

[Automatic setup using the command line](/tinker/2-setup/auto-cli/){ .md-button }
[Automatic setup using a web interface](/tinker/2-setup/auto-web/){ .md-button }

We also supply manual instructions for setting up the repository. They require a bit more familiarity with the command line and reading comprehension, but it's not too hard to do.
