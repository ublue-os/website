A new web interface for automatic setup [is currently in a beta/demo phase](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/discussions/173). To try it out, go to [https://ublue-images-demo.netlify.app/](https://ublue-images-demo.netlify.app/). If you encounter any issues with it, you can report the in [the issue tracker](https://github.com/ublue-os/images-website/issues).

!!! note

    Due to the settings of the ublue-os GitHub organization, this tool currently gives errors when you have already forked `ublue-os/startingpoint` and it tries to generate a repository using the template.
