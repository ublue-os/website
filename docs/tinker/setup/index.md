# Setting up the repository

This section helps you set up a GitHub repository for building your custom image and signing it.

There are two ways to do this step automatically, with a command line program and with a web interface:

[Automatic setup using the command line](/tinker/setup/auto-cli/){ .md-button }
[Automatic setup using a web interface](/tinker/setup/auto-web/){ .md-button }

We also supply manual instructions for setting up the repository. These instructions require a bit more reading, familiarity with the command line.
