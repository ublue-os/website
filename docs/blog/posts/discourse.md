# Moving to Discourse

We've gotten large enough where we need a more featureful place for discussions outside of GitHub, and for a place for the community to collate and improve documentation.

So we're moving to a forum: 

## [universal-blue.discourse.group](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/)

and check out the new [Bazzite Buzz #8](https://universal-blue.discourse.group/t/bazzite-buzz-8/72) for some new Bazzite updates. You'll find sections for all your favorite Universal Blue topics, so come say hello!
