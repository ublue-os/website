# Happy 2nd birthday!

Though this project may seem new, the [first commit](https://github.com/castrojo/ublue/commit/e0f113a98b98bb0782ecf9314e5348b60d7f2357) on this journey is a little bit over two years old! At the time "ublue" was just an imperative script. 

Later that year, in November 2021 the first edition of what became the [OSTree Native Containers spec](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainer) was committed to the Fedora wiki. This flipped the project on it's head and the rest is history!

We've picked July 21st as our birthday since it's coming up (and we also forgot). So today we're celebrating two years of cloud-native goodness, thanks for hanging out with us!
