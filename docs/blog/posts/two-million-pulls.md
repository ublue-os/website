# Two Million Image Pulls!

WE DID IT!

Today we crossed two million image pulls. Specifically we have 2,005,118! We crossed one million on [July 19th](https://universal-blue.org/blog/2023/07/19/one-million-image-pulls-happy-birthday-to-us/). 

Some minor updates for this new million. Kinoite continues to [be the most popular image](https://github.com/orgs/ublue-os/packages). However, `silverblue-nvidia` has snuck in and claimed second place from `kinoite-main`, rounding out our top three. `base-nvidia` comes in fourth, which is basically an "empty" image with Fedora and no desktop -- so that means plenty of you are using that as a base image and building something with it, great job!

Though pulls aren't an indicator of users, this means that we've had a two million daily upgrades, which isn't a bad start! 

## Fedora Podcast!

We'll be on the Fedora Podcast next week with [Timoth√©e Ravier](https://github.com/travier) from the CoreOS team. Without his work this project wouldn't be possible so we're looking forward to talking about what's coming down the pipe!

## Don't forget F39 is here!

Also a quick reminder that we are publishing images for F39. They don't get published to the image list but they do exist for most of the images. Take a peek in the [packages section](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/pkgs/container/bluefin) for the image you care about and give it a shot! We're feeling pretty good about F39 being a smooth transition for users. 

And we hope you'll be around to help us hit 3 million!
