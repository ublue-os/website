# Community Values

Derived from the [Kubernetes Community Values](https://kubernetes.io/community/values/) but with a more hometown feel: 

## Distribution is better than centralization
Distributed asynchronous ownership, collaboration, communication and decision making.  

## Automation over process 
We value time spent automating repetitive work more highly than toil.

## Inclusive is better than exclusive
Broadly successful and useful technologies require different perspectives and skill sets, which can only be heard in a welcoming and respectful environment. Our community respects the time and effort put into a discussion.

## Evolution is better than stagnation
Openness to new ideas and studied technological evolution make us a stronger project. 

... and we can't have all that without the quote: 

"Culture eats strategy for breakfast." --Peter Drucker
