# Universal Blue's old custom image tooling is moving

Per mutual decisision ([ublue-os/startingpoint#223](https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint/issues/223) & [ublue-os/main#476](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/issues/476)), the custom image build tooling based on recipes is moving to a different organization as it's own project. [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) is the new place to get support and documentation. The same maintaners are continuing work on the project. 

More information regarding things such as migration is going to be published later this month. In the meantime, _don't panic_, your current custom image repository is going to keep working.
