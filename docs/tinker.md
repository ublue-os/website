# Universal Blue's old custom image tooling has been moved

Per mutual decisision ([ublue-os/startingpoint#223](https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint/issues/223) & [ublue-os/main#476](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/issues/476)), the custom image build tooling based on recipes is moving to a different organization as it's own project. [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/) is the new place to get support and documentation. The same maintaners are continuing work on the project.

Read the [full introductory blog post](https://blue-build.org/blog/introducing-bluebuild/) (including a migration guide) on BlueBuild's website. _Don't panic_, you can keep your existing configuration, and your current custom image repository is going to keep working with no required changes for at least a few months.
