# Universal-Blue

## Custom Operating System images based on Fedora

This is a collection of container images using Fedora's [support for OCI/Docker containers as a transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable). In short, we generate images here to build your perfect desktop. The original mission was to build an Ubuntu-like experience for Silverblue, however containers have changed the game, making customization easier. This project's new purpose is to be a "kit" for you to derive from to create your perfect image. 

- Pull requests gladly accepted, we're trying to figure out if a community-curated set of images can make something awesome.
- Experimentation encouraged!
