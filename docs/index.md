## Custom Operating System images based on Fedora

This is a collection of container images using Fedora's support for OCI/Docker containers as a [transport and delivery mechanism for operating system content](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/OstreeNativeContainerStable).

This project's purpose is to:

- Provide a diverse set of Fedoral based images for people to use as their desktop operating system.
- Provide a diverse set of tools and reusable automation "kits" for more technical users so that they can customize and share their images with others.
- Act as a proving ground for new ideas around the Linux desktop.
